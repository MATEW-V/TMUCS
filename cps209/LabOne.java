        Fill in the methods below according to the descriptions given.

        You should test your code by calling your methods in the main
        method provided. One sample call for each method is given,
        but you should write your own test cases in main() and try them
        out as you go.

        Once you're satisfied that your methods are producing the correct
        results, you can scroll down to the very bottom of this file
        for instructions on how to run the unit tests. 

        Note that your official lab grade will be based on the unit tests
        and not what you wrote in main(), but it's still a good idea 
        to practice writing your own main() method. You won't always be
        given unit tests.

    /* PROBLEM 1)
     *
     * Python has the integer exponentiation operator ** conveniently built 
     * in the language, whereas Java unfortunately does not offer that. 
     *
     * Instead of integer exponentiation, however, you will implement the 
     * related operation of "falling power". Each term multiplied into the 
     * product is always one less than the previous term. 
     * 
     * For example, the fallingPower(8, 3) is computed as 8 × 7 × 6 = 336. 
     * Similarly, the fallingPower(10, 5) equals 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 = 30240. 
     * 
     * Nothing essential changes in this calculation when the base is negative; 
     * the fallingPower(–4, 5) is computed as –4 × –5 × –6 × –7 × –8 = –6720. 
     * Similar to normal exponentiation, fallingPower(n, 0) = 1 for any nonzero 
     * integer n.
     * 
     * This method should return the fallingPower(n, k) where the base n can be 
     * any integer, and the exponent k can be any integer greater than zero.
     * 
     * Hint: notice that the return type is long... you should probably declare
     * and store your running result similarly, as a long int.

    /* PROBLEM 2)
     *
     * Inside an array arr, an inversion is a pair of two positions i<j 
     * such that arr[i]>arr[j]. In combinatorics, the inversion count inside 
     * an array is a rough measure of how “out of order” that array is. 
     *
     * If an array is sorted in ascending order, it has zero inversions, 
     * whereas an n-element array sorted in reverse order has n(n–1)/2 
     * inversions, the largest number possible. 
     *
     * This method should count the inversions inside the given array arr, 
     * and return that count. As always when writing methods that operate on 
     * arrays, make sure that your method works correctly for arrays of any 
     * length, including the important special cases arrays with length zero 
     * and one.
